# Comic-Gems
This project was produced in the course Advanced Web Design with CSS3. The focus of the project was the coding, not the design. This comic book themed website implements advanced CSS transitions. When you hover over the image of a graphic novel, the image flattens in animated motion (Advanced CSS3 transition). When you click the image, it directs you to a separate landing page, which provides a link to an external source for more information.
