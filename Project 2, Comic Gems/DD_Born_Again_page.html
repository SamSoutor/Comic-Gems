<div class="description">Before Frank Miller was known for his Sin City and Batman work,
he created what is considered by both Marvel and Daredevil fans to be the definitive
tale of The Man Without Fear. After Karen Page, Matt Murdock's former lover, reveals
his secret identity to get a drug fix, he must find strength as the Kingpin wastes no
time in tracking him down. Paperback is the best way to obtain a copy, to reserve a copy,
go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134816/ref=s9_simh_gw_g14_i3_r?ie=UTF8&fpl=fresh&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=1QAN5J8ZF9GKDJWZD8XS&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop">
Amazon.com</a>. If any of you watch the Daredevil show set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you could request the creators to adapt this
story as a film on Netflix. I'm sure many Marvel fans would approve of this.
