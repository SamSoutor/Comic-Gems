<div class="description">You may know that Alan Moore wrote Watchmen, the most celebrated
graphic novel. He also wrote The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. 
What if I were to tell you that Moore wrote another legendary comic recognized
by many comic book fans. V for Vendetta tells the story of a mysterious man in a white
porcelain mask who fights political oppressors through terrorism and absurd acts. Later
adapted into film, it is recommended by many that you read this book before you see the
film. Reserve your copy at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/V-Vendetta-Alan-Moore/dp/140120841X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1457050497&sr=1-1&keywords=v+for+vendetta">
Amazon.com</a>. If your lucky, maybe you'll get a copy that has a Guy Fawkes mask for you to wear!
