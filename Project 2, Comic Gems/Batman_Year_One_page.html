<div class="description">Published in 1986, Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is a 
groundbreaking reinterpretation of the origin of The Dark Knight himself. Commissoner
Gordon also receives some backstory as well. Written 
shortly after The Dark Knight Returns, 
the dystopian fable of Batman's final days,
 Year One set the stage for a new vision of a legendary character. 
Elements of the graphic novel have appeared in both live-action and animated adaptions of the character.
The paperback edition is widely available, so if you want, you can reserve your own copy at
<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/batman-frederic-p-miller/1102927547?ean=9781401207526">

original source.
