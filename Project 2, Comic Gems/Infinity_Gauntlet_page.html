<div class="description">As many of you are aware, Phase 3 of The Marvel Cinematic
Universe will begin on May 6th, 2016 with Captain America: Civil War. Immediately
after that, The Avengers will engage Thanos in The Infinity War between 2018 and 2019.
The Infinity War movies will take inspiration from this graphic novel which tells the
story of The Avengers, The New Warriors, The X-Men and many more as they did battle
against The Mad Titan. I can't give away too many details, but I recommend that you
reserve your copy at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Gauntlet-Jim-Starlin/dp/0785156593/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1457047077&sr=1-1&keywords=the+infinity+gauntlet">
Amazon.com</a>to find out what happens! This story also inspired the name of this website. The Infinity Gems form a gauntlet around
the logo. Feel free to choose which power you would wield!
