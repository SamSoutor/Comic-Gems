<div class="description">The title doesn't lie, Superman did actually die in DC Comics
during the 90s. Considered to be a publicity stunt in order to get people to read more
Superman comics, The Death of Superman has its place in history. Witness page-by-page the
climatic battle between The Man of Steel and the creature that killed him, Doomsday! This
comic would later be adapted into the animated film "Superman: Doomsday" released in 2007.
I suggust reading the comic before seeing the animated film, so reserve your copy at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Superman-Dan-Jurgens/dp/1401241824/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457050247&sr=8-1&keywords=the+death">
Amazon.com</a>. There's even more after you finish this story, so make sure to track down copies of Reign of The Supermen!
I've also heard rumors that parts of the story could show up in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice!
