<div class="description">Not only does Frank Miller have his place in Batman's 
history,
but so does Alan Moore. Considered to be the definitive tale of The Joker, 
Batman: The 
Killing Joke has been highly praised for its dark tone and exploration 
of the relationship 
between Batman and The Joker. Soon to be an animated film 
starring the legendary duo of
 Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy. As of this time, we are
unable to find a paperback edition of the graphic novel. If you like, we can provide
you a link to <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/batman-alan-moore/1000193854?ean=9781401216672">
Barnes and Noble.com</a> to reserve a hardcover copy. I should also mention that there is a brief section after the story that
you should check out. Perhaps it could make an appearance in the upcoming animated film.
